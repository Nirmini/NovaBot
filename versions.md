# Version numbers/IDs in Nova
---
## Nova uses a variation of sematic versioning. This means that major and/or breaking changes will be a change in the x number and medium to small patches result in a change to the y number. With the version number being XX.YY with an optional ZZ at the end if needed.

Actually we use sematic versioning on the backend again and just use this in front of the customer/user.
